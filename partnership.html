        <h2>Partner with YouthSkills SA: Empowering South Africa’s Youth, Fueling Economic Growth</h2>
        <p>South Africa faces a dual crisis—youth unemployment and a critical skills mismatch. At YouthSkills SA, we are addressing these challenges by creating a pipeline of job-ready talent in high-demand sectors such as renewable energy, tech, and trades.</p>

        <h2>Why We Are Doing This</h2>
        <p>South Africa’s youth unemployment is not just a statistic—it’s a systemic failure. Over <strong>3.4 million young South Africans</strong> are neither employed nor in education, while industries like renewable energy and IT struggle to fill roles due to skills shortages.</p>

        <h2>What We Aim to Achieve</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Train 1,000 youth annually</strong> in certifications aligned with SA’s Critical Skills List (e.g., solar installation, coding, AI basics).</li>
            <li><strong>Place 70% of graduates</strong> into jobs, internships, or gig projects within 6 months.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduce dependency on social grants</strong> by creating a skilled workforce that contributes R500M annually to the economy by 2027.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Partner with Us?</h2>
        <p>Your impact will be measurable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>B-BBEE Compliance:</strong> Earn points via Skills Development contributions (SETA-accredited programs).</li>
            <li><strong>ESG Alignment:</strong> Support UN SDG 8 (Decent Work) and SA’s National Development Plan.</li>
            <li><strong>Workforce Pipeline:</strong> Access pre-trained talent in high-demand fields like renewable energy and IT.</li>
        </ul>
