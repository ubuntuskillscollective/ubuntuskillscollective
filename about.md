# About YouthSkills SA

**Our Mission**  
At YouthSkills SA, our mission is to empower South African youth by bridging the skills gap and equipping them with the tools and training needed to succeed in high-demand sectors. We believe that by transforming challenges into opportunities, we can drive economic growth and build sustainable futures for communities across the nation.

## What We Do  
YouthSkills SA is a data-driven non-profit organization (NPO) dedicated to tackling two critical issues:

### 1. Youth Unemployment  
With a significant percentage of young South Africans either unemployed or underemployed, we work to create pathways into meaningful employment.

### 2. Skills Mismatch  
Many industries—especially in renewable energy, technology, and trades—face a shortage of skilled workers. We address this gap by offering training that aligns with the demands of the modern job market.

## Our Approach  

### Data-Driven Insights  
Through comprehensive surveys and community engagement, we collect detailed data on:  
- Education levels  
- Certifications  
- Specific barriers youth face (e.g., transport costs, lack of devices)  

This information shapes our training programs and helps us target areas where intervention is most needed.

## Why It Matters  
South Africa faces a dual crisis:  
1. **Skyrocketing Youth Unemployment**  
   Over 3.4 million young South Africans are unemployed (Stats SA, 2023).  
2. **Critical Skills Shortages**  
   Example: The renewable energy sector needs **26,000 skilled technicians by 2030** but lacks accessible training programs.  

Our initiatives:  
- **Reduce Unemployment**: Empower youth to secure sustainable jobs.  
- **Fuel Economic Growth**: Turn unemployment into a driver of progress.  
- **Break Poverty Cycles**: Reduce dependency on social grants.  

---

## Our Vision  
We envision a South Africa where **every young person** has access to the education and training necessary to thrive in the modern economy. By bridging the gap between formal education and employer needs, YouthSkills SA is committed to transforming the youth unemployment crisis into an opportunity for innovation, resilience, and economic inclusion.
